Deep Reinforcement Learning for Detecting Anomaly in Telemetry Water Level

I explored deep reinforcement learing as a method to detect the anomaly in water level data for answer the question "Is DRL applicable for identifying abnormalities in telemetry water level data?". For the DRL model, a multilayer perceptron network is used in the Q-network. A significant problem in training neural networks is determining how long they should be trained. Too few epochs may result in the model learning insufficiently, whereas too many epochs may result in the model over-fitting. So, the performance of the model must be monitored during training by evaluating it on the validation set at the end of each epoch and updating the model if the performance of the model on a validation is better than at the previous epoch. With this approach, we will always have the model with the best performance. We selected four metrics to evaluate the performance of each epoch, including F1-score, rewards of each epoch, accuracy, and validation loss values. In the end, we will have five models: the finished training model ($DRL$), the models with the highest f1-score (`DRL_F1`), the models with the highest rewards (`DRL_Rwd`), the model with the highest accuracy (`DRL_Acc`), and the model with the lowest validation loss values (`DRL_Valid`).
